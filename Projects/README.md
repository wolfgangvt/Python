# Project Folder Information
Howdy! Welcome to the Poject Folder! This folder will contain ONLY offline projects to demonstrate my ability to code and work on serious projects that tests my knowledge and ability to code. I will present these files and projects as benchmarks of our progression into this coding journey! Ideas and advice will be used from chat, but work and overall progress will be done by me. Every file here is thanks to you guys, I appreciate every single one of you! Much love!

## Rules
I will set some ground rules, I must be fair not only to you but to the learning process as a whole!

1. No AI!!!!! No Google Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.
2. No downloaded files sent from viewers, community members, and chat; will be updated untill I have mods to check stuff lol.
3. Be kind and patient as I am still learning how to code properly, what may seem simple/easy for you is an entirely new concept for me. Please provide me with patience.
4. Ideas are welcomed! Criticism is welcome! Harrassment, rude behavior, or any sort of bullying among community membes and myself is not tolerated!
5. I will NOT do files or coding that goes beyond the scope of Python/Pygames/or other similar packages, i.e. C++ or other coding languages
6. Downloading work here and publishing as your own is strictly prohibited, the goal here is to learn not copy and paste work of the community as your own bruh.
