# Journal Folder Information
Howdy! Welcome to the Journal Folder! This folder will contain personal statements after streams, videos, etc. regarding this coding journey. They may come in forms of announcements, personal blogs, statements/notices, etc. It may come in markdown files, python text files, or text files in general. IT IS NOT A DIARY, but a good way to update y'all on personal stuff and chats outside of DMs because I don't know y'all like that. 

## Rules
1. Be nice dayo
2. This is one of the best ways for me to communicate to you outside of my socials if I choose to get rid of some or not communicate on them fluently.
3. No coding, just comments or text files for y'all to look at and react to ig

## Announcements

## Blogs/Personal Stuff
