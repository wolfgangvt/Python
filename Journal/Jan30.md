# Journal Entry: January 30, 2025

Howdy! This is the first installment of the GitHub journal for yours truly, Wolfgang! 

## Updates and Announcements

Starting today, I will be starting to consistently streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wolfgangvten) and will post regularly on YouTube and short form social media sites! I might even be live right now. I do not have a comprehensive artist or designed yet, so everything will be scuffed or look off to which I apologize my slimes (rose emoji).

Some updates I wanted to let y'all know of is that I have started to voluntarily read books again! Exciting, I know! Concerning? ... I know bruh.  
I haven't read a book by myself or without school mandating policies since high school, and I'm about to graduate university LMAO.
