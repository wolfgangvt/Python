# Testing Folder Information

Howdy! Welcome to the Testing Folder. This folder will mainly be utilized off-stream as this will be a windown for y'all to see experimental practices of my coding techniques and methodology. I will take advice, though, to efficiently code projects from other folders to limit the amount of code lines. This folder may not have as many updates as a result, but I am looking forward to learning on how to improve my coding efficiency!

## Rules
I will set some ground rules, I must be fair not only to you but to the learning process as a whole!

1. No AI!!!!! No Google Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.
2. No downloaded files sent from viewers, community members, and chat; will be updated untill I have mods to check stuff lol.
3. Be kind and patient as I am still learning how to code properly, what may seem simple/easy for you is an entirely new concept for me. Please provide me with patience.
4. Ideas are welcomed! Criticism is welcome! Harrassment, rude behavior, or any sort of bullying among community membes and myself is not tolerated!
5. I will NOT do files or coding that goes beyond the scope of Python/Pygames/or other similar packages, i.e. C++ or other coding languages
6. Downloading work here and publishing as your own is strictly prohibited, the goal here is to learn not copy and paste work of the community as your own bruh.
