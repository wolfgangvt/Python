#  Learning Folder Information

Howdy! Welcome to the Learning Folder! This folder will contain various files from previously live-streamed coding streams or videos published on YouTube! I will use any and all advice and project ideas to help myself and you learn how to code Python. From beginner to professional projects, these projects will range as time goes on and we continue to navigate this coding journey together!  

##  Rules
I will set some ground rules, I must be fair not only to you but to the learning process as a whole!

1. No AI!!!!! No Google Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.
2. No downloaded files sent from viewers, community members, and chat; will be updated untill I have mods to check stuff lol.
3. Be kind and patient as I am still learning how to code properly, what may seem simple/easy for you is an entirely new concept for me. Please provide me with patience.
4. Ideas are welcomed! Criticism is welcome! Harrassment, rude behavior, or any sort of bullying among community membes and myself is not tolerated!
5. I will NOT do files or coding that goes beyond the scope of Python/Pygames/or other similar packages, i.e. C++ or other coding languages
6. Downloading work here and publishing as your own is strictly prohibited, the goal here is to learn not copy and paste work of the community as your own bruh.
