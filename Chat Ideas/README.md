# Chat Ideas Folder
Howdy! Welcome to the Chat Ideas Folder! This folder will contain project ideas brought upon by chat and the communtiy in general. This may contain small or large projects in Python, but chat and I will use this as a way to collaborate without actually coding one project together. This may be in forms of text files filled with brainstormed ideas, full-on projects to entertain ourselves, video ideas and implementation (DougDoug style type shi).

## Rules
I will set some ground rules, I must be fair not only to you but to the learning process as a whole!

1. No AI!!!!! No Google Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.
2. No downloaded files sent from viewers, community members, and chat; will be updated untill I have mods to check stuff lol.
3. Be kind and patient as I am still learning how to code properly, what may seem simple/easy for you is an entirely new concept for me. Please provide me with patience.
4. Ideas are welcomed! Criticism is welcome! Harrassment, rude behavior, or any sort of bullying among community membes and myself is not tolerated!
5. I will NOT do files or coding that goes beyond the scope of Python/Pygames/or other similar packages, i.e. C++ or other coding languages
6. Downloading work here and publishing as your own is strictly prohibited, the goal here is to learn not copy and paste work of the community as your own bruh.
